Using Leaflet to overlay the index page in LoC's Sanborn Maps with links to the indicated pages

This tool uses Leaflet and the Leaflet-IIIF plugin to pull the index page of a Sanborn Map in from the Library of Congress. The GeoJSON in test.js describes a feature for each page in the volume which will provide a clickable link to that page from the index.
